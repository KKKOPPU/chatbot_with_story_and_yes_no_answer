# chatbot_with_story_and_yes_no_answer

Bots are specially built software that interacts with internet users automatically. Bots are made up of algorithms that assist them in completing jobs. By auto-designed, we mean that they run on their own, following instructions, and therefore begin the conservation process without the need for human intervention. 
Bots are responsible for the majority of internet traffic. For e-commerce sites, traffic can be significantly higher, accounting for up to 90% of total traffic. They can communicate with people and on social media accounts, as well as on websites.

# Type of Bots

1. ChatBot — An Artificial Intelligence (AI) programme that communicates with users through app, message, or phone. It is most commonly utilised by Twitter.
2. Social Media Bot- Created for social media sites to answer automatically all at once.
3. Google Bot is commonly used for indexing and crawling. Spider Bots—Developed for retrieving data from websites, the Google Bot is widely used for indexing and crawling. 
4. Spam Bots are programmed that automatically send spam emails to a list of addresses. 
5. Transactional Bots are bots that are designed to be used in transactions. 
6. Monitoring Bots – Creating bots to keep track of the system’s or website’s health. 

In this chatbot model, we will tell a story and can ask quesstion based on the available vocabulary of words. We will receive an output as yes/no (with a probability of how accurate our predicted answer can be) based on the chatbots understanding from the story and the question.
